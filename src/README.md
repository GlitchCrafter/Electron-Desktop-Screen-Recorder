this is a test project i was attempting by following a video tutorial by Fireship on youtube.

THe tutorial is outdated as electron has removed some support for certain code, thee are small fixes within the comment of the video but new errors are starting to pop up. 

Since the code base looks like is depreciated i will not continue with this project.

I also suggest running and audit with npm or your terminal if you have also started this project. some of the packages needed for this project created numerous critical vulnerabilities in my system related to sockets and unix code. I uninstalled the original packages and ran an audit fix, it seems to have resolved the issues.

Since ive been coding for about 3 hours, i have no idea if these critical vulnerabilities are common or are dangerous. 

inform yourself on these issues like i am.

It would have been such a fun project to build. i think i will attempt it in another maintained language some day !
